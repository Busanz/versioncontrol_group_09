        <h1>Getting start with remote repositories</h1>
        <p>
          Throughout this article, aiming to explain the importance of learning
          about version control systems and how they are essential for teamwork
          and how to get start using version control platforms. In addition, we
          will explore how to create a GitHub project, the key Git commands for
          setting up and linking a local repository, and how others can
          effectively contribute to your project.

            Imagine you are working on a coding project, and suddenly something
            goes wrong, maybe your local machine crashes or a file gets
            corrupted. It is a sinking feeling that every developer knows too
            well. Now, consider switching between different computers, say from
            your desktop to your laptop, the experience is not exactly seamless.
            And when it comes to collaborating on the same project with others,
            keeping everything in sync can be even more challenging. <br />
            <br />This is why remote repositories have become an absolutely
            essential tool for developers.

            Following steps from this article is demonstrated the step-by-step
            guidance for installing and using Git and version control systems
            (e.g.: GitHub) will be demonstrated. Novice learners will be guided
            through initializing a repository on GitHub, checking if Git has
            been installed and initializing a project locally and connect to
            remoteRepo. Each process will be clearly explained to help beginners
            understand how modifications in code are tracked, managed, and
            shared effectively.

            The most popular Git platform is
            <span class="highlight_words">GitHub</span>, which operates based on
            the Git version control system. Similar to other remote storage
            platforms like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox, GitHub also
            consists of two main storage layers, the
            <span class="highlight_words">local machine</span> and the
            <span class="highlight_words">remote cloud location</span>. However,
            GitHub is specifically designed for
            <span class="highlight_words"
              >version control and code-based development projects</span
            >, making it much more than just a storage service.
            <br /><br />Within the local storage, Git organizes files into three
            main layers to efficiently handle code changes:
          </p>

                  which contains the actual project files being created or
                  modified by the user

                <p>
                  The <span class="highlight_words">Index (Staging Area)</span>,
                  where selected files are prepared to be sent to the remote
                  repository this can include one file or multiple files.

                  >, which holds the finalized versions of files that are ready

            Now we have a remote repository, the next step to be create a
            directory for the store project files locally and link to the remote
            GitHub project.
          </p>
          <h3>Create a project locally</h3>
          <p class="process_step_instruction">
            1. As a first step of need to conform that you have installed
            <code>Git</code> in your local machine
          </p>
          <p>
            By default most of the modern macOS devices shipped with installed
            but not all the time for Windows.open your terminal (if you can open
            Git Bash prompt on window that mean, might have installed Git) and
            type:
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_command"><code>git --version</code></p>
          <p>
            If git is installed on local machine it show something like below:
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_command"><code> git version 2.51.0</code></p>
          <p>
            If it shows an error message something like “command not found”, it
            means Git is not installed in local machine. So need to
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">
              install git</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_instruction">
            2. Create a directory for your local project files
          </p>
          <p>Open the terminal and follow the below steps.</p>
          <p class="process_step_command">
            <em># 1. Create a new directory</em>
            <code>mkdir &lt;project_directory_name&gt; </code>
          </p>

          <p class="process_step_command">
            <em># 2. Move into the directory</em>
            <code>cd &lt;project_directory_name&gt; </code>
          </p>

          <p class="process_step_instruction">
            3. Initialize the created directory for Git
          </p>
          <p>
            After move into the created directory and initializing that
            directory for Git. This creates local GitRepo which track all the
            changes in locally (this make a hidden directory call
            <code>.git</code> inside itself).
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_command">
            <code>git init</code>
          </p>

          <h3>Link a local repo to a remote repo</h3>
          <p>
            So far, created a directory and initialized that with Git and now it
            is the time to make a connection between local directory and remote
            GitHub repository.
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_instruction">1. Goto the GitHub</p>
          <p>
            Select is repository tab and select the created project and select
            on the "&lt;&gt;Code" button and copy the URL under
            <code>HTPPS</code>.
          </p>
          <img

            height="auto"
            class="project_article_img"
          />
          <p class="process_step_instruction">2. Create a connection</p>
          <p>
            To make a link between locally initialized directory and remote repo
            in GitHub account. Run the below command in terminal replace the
            copied URL with own one (Make sure to be inside the previously
            created directory).
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_command">
            <code>git remote add origin &lt;replace_with_URL&gt;</code>
          </p>

          <h3>Add files locally and push to remote</h3>
          <p>
            Up to this point, created connection between local and remote. Let
            learn how to create a file and make a snapshot of it in remote
            location
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_instruction">
            1. Create a file in the local directory
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file inside the local directory as example
            <code>index.html</code>. It can be done by UI or in the terminal
            (Make sure to be inside the previously created directory). Run below
            command to create a file.
          </p>

          <p class="process_step_command">
            <em>#On Windows OS</em>
            <code>echo. > index.html</code>
          </p>
          <p class="process_step_command">
            <em>#On macOS, Linux</em>
            <code>touch index.html</code>
          </p>

          <p class="process_step_instruction">2. Add created file to Staging</p>
          <p>
            Now the the step to generate list of locally created or modified
            files and add into the staging layer. To do so run the below
            command. Every time that make a changes locally inside the directory
            it need to be perform.
          </p>
