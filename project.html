        <h1>Getting start with remote repositories</h1>
        <p>
          Throughout this article, aiming to explain the importance of learning
          about version control systems and how they are essential for teamwork
          and how to get start using version control platforms. In addition, we
          will explore how to create a GitHub project, the key Git commands for
          setting up and linking a local repository, and how others can
          effectively contribute to your project.

            Imagine you are working on a coding project, and suddenly something
            goes wrong, maybe your local machine crashes or a file gets
            corrupted. It is a sinking feeling that every developer knows too
            well. Now, consider switching between different computers, say from
            your desktop to your laptop, the experience is not exactly seamless.
            And when it comes to collaborating on the same project with others,
            keeping everything in sync can be even more challenging. <br />
            <br />This is why remote repositories have become an absolutely
            essential tool for developers.

                  latest update from others. This does not required other
                  communication media to sync the code base.
