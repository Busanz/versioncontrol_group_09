          Our team consist of Sevilay Guns, Buddhi Thotawaththage, Simge Ates.
          We are first year front end students at Future Games. This project
          allowed us to work closely together and learn Git and GitHub version
          control systems in a practical, collaborative way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website you are viewing was created using version control
          workflows, including creating branches, submitting pull requests, and
          merging changes. Throughout the project, we learned a lot through
          trial and error.

        <p>
          As beginners, we faced challenges such as coding in the wrong branches
          or not properly applying pulled changes to our local branches.
          However, our team successfully overcame these obstacles and gained a
          solid understanding of version control practices.

        <p>We hope you enjoy exploring our project and find it informative.</p>
