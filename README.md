# Front-End Version Control Project

## üìÅ Project Description

This project was part of our first-year Front-End course at **Future Games**.

It helped us learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** to collaborate effectively and manage code as part of a development team.

Learning how to connect Git and GitHub, create and manage branches, and work effectively as a team was our main goal throughout this project.
Together, we successfully overcame merge conflicts, supported each other, and maintained great collaboration from start to finish.
We‚Äôre proud of what we accomplished and are excited to share the results with you.

The initial setup of the project including the general style.css and index.html files was created by one team member.
After the initial stage, the tasks were divided, and each team member started working on their own page.
During the development process, we encountered several merge conflicts while using Git and GitHub, which we resolved together as a team.
Although each member focused on their own part of the project, we constantly supported each other ‚Äî both technically and stylistically to ensure consistency and teamwork throughout the development.

By the end of this project, we gained solid knowledge about Git and GitHub and learned how to apply version control in a practical way.  
We have shared what we learned on our website to help others understand these concepts as well.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Project Folder

cd to the directory `cd versioncontrol_group_09`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

You can open the folder in VS Code by running:

`code .`

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ View the Website

Open **index.html** in your browser to see the project live.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Create a Branch

If you want to make changes without affecting the main project:

Replace new-feature with your branch name.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Committing and Pushing Changes

`git add .`

2-Commit the changes (add a message describing what you did):

`git commit -m "Describe your changes"`

3-Push your branch to GitHub (upload your work to the remote repository):
