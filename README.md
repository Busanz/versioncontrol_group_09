# Front-End Version Control Project
## About the project
This project was part of our first-year Front-End course at **Future Games**.  
It helped us learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** to collaborate and manage code like real developers.

The initial setup of the project — including the **general style.css** and **index.html** files — was created by one team member.  
After the initial stage, the tasks were divided, and each team member started working on their own page.  
During the development process, we encountered several merge conflicts while using Git and GitHub, which we resolved together as a team.  

By the end of this project, we gained solid knowledge about Git and GitHub and learned how to apply version control in a practical way.  
We have shared what we learned on our website to help others understand these concepts as well.
