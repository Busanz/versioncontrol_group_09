      <h1>What is version control?</h1>
      <article class="main_article">
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system that lets multiple people
          work on a project simultaneously, keep a history of changes, and
          easily switch between different versions of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main goal of our Version Control project is to fully understand
          version control systems and share the knowledge we've gained.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this website, we present the topics we learned through
          hands-on experience, providing valuable insights for our visitors.
          During our project, we explored certain key topics and shared them on
          our website. You can find these topics and related content here.This
          guide explains how to open a project on GitHub, connect it to a local
          repository, and use the essential Git commands during the process. It
          also describes how people can contribute effectively to the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our project, we used Git branches to manage different features and
          tasks separately. Branching allowed us to work simultaneously without
          interfering with each other's code, making collaboration easier and
          safer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monitoring changes allowed us to collaborate efficiently, fix errors
          promptly, and maintain a clear development history. Once our work on
          the develop branch was complete, we merged the changes back into the
          main branch to keep the project up to date.
