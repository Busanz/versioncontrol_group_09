        <h1 class="changes_title">Making and Saving Changes in Git</h1>
        <p class="page_description">Once your repository is created, the real work begins; writing code, editing files,
          and improving your project. Git helps you keep track of every change you make and makes it easy to share your
          updates with your. This page walks you through the process of updating an existing Git repository. You'll see
          how to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stage your modified files</li>
          <li>Commit those changes with clear messages</li>
          <li>Push them to your remote repository on GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding The Git Work Flow</h2>
        <p>Before sending your code to GitHub, there are three main steps to follow:</p>
        <div class="commands">
          <h3>1.Staging</h3>
          <p>Think of staging like putting files in a ‚Äúready-to-send‚Äù box. When you make changes in your project, Git
            doesn't automatically include them. You first need to stage the files you want to save.</p>
          <p class="command_description"># For staging a specific file</p>
          <p class="command_syntax">git add filename.html</p>
          <p class="command_description"># For staging all changed files</p>
          <p class="command_syntax">git add .</p>
          <p>üí° Tip: The dot (.) means ‚Äúadd everything I've changed.‚Äù</p>
        </div>
        <div class="commands">
          <h3>2.Committing</h3>
          <p>Committing is like taking a snapshot of your staged changes. Once you've staged your files, a commit
            permanently records those changes in your local repository (your computer), with a short message explaining
            what you did.</p>
          <p class="command_description"># For committing the staged files</p>
          <p class="command_syntax">git commit -m "add your message here"</p>
          <p>üí° Tip: The message should describe why or what you changed, not just ‚Äúupdate.‚Äù</p>
        </div>
        <div class="commands">
          <h3>3.Pushing</h3>
          <p>Pushing is like sending your snapshot to the cloud (GitHub). When you push, you upload your local commits
            to the remote repository so your teammates can see and use them.</p>
          <p class="command_description"># If it's your first time pushing this branch, you might need to link it</p>
          <p class="command_syntax">git push -u origin your_branch_name</p>
          <p class="command_description"># For pushing after you linked</p>
          <p class="command_syntax">git push</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Best Practices for Using Git:</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><span class="span">Commit often and clearly:</span> Make small, frequent commits with descriptive messages
            (e.g., "Add footer links" instead of "Update").</li>
          <li><span class="span">Pull before you push:</span> Always run git pull to get the latest updates
            before pushing your own work.</li>
          <li><span class="span">Check before committing:</span> Use git status to review what's being committed, avoid
            adding unnecessary files.</li>
          <li><span class="span">Push regularly:</span> Don't wait too long to push changes, so your team always
            works with the latest version.</li>
          <li><span class="span">Keep branches clean:</span> Delete old or merged branches to keep the project
            tidy.</li>
